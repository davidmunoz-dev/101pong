# 101pong

Pong, developped as an arcade game in 1972 by Ralph Baer (Atari), is the first ever successful video game. It was in-
spired by the very first video game, Tennis for Two, developped in 1958 by William Higinbotham on an oscilloscope.

The goal of this project is to work on a 3d version of this game (or of the Brick Break game by the way...) ; only one bat
will be considered, moving only in the 0-altitude plan (which happens to be (Oxy)).
